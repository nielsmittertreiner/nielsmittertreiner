## Hi there, I'm Niels Mittertreiner, or BSBob

I'm a Dutch Games and Interaction student at the University of Arts Utrecht!

I have a fascination for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance and the 3rd generation Pokémon games. Especially Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald. That's why I decided to make ROM-hacks and related projects for fun using decompilation projects from [pret](https://github.com/pret).

I am also working on a C++ library for GameBoy Advance homebrew programming called LibAGX. (repository coming soon!)
