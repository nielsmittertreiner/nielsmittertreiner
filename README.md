## Hi there, I'm Niels Mittertreiner, or BSBob

I'm a Dutch student, following Game Development and I have a fascination for the 3rd generation of Pokémon games. Especially Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald. That's why I decided to make ROM-hacks and related projects for fun using decompilation projects from [pret](https://github.com/pret).
